There is a great deal of overlap between the two fields of study. At Wayne State both types of engineering programs have a strong emphasis on math and science, especially physics and calculus. While topics of core classes in both programs seem similar, engineering technology classes will emphasize the application of engineering techniques"

      "details": "Health Sciences is the study of improving healthcare systems and policies with knowledge from STEM disciplines: Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. In other words, Health Sciences looks at the latest discoveries in these areas and tries to apply them for medical purposes. The results are more efficient healthcare institutions, improved reliability of medical devices and systems, well-implemented emergency plans, and so on.Health Sciences is a broad discipline. This is why not all programmes have the same academic goals. Certain degrees focus more on Nutrition Sciences, others on Exercise Sciences, and the list of examples can go on. What students need to know is that Health Sciences is the ideal choice if they want to make a difference in healthcare provision at the administration or policy level."
